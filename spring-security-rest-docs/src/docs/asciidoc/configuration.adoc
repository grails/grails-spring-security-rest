=== Installing the plugin

Just proceed as with any other Grails 3 plugin:

[source,groovy,subs="attributes+"]
.`build.gradle`
----
dependencies {

    //Other dependencies

    compile "org.grails.plugins:spring-security-rest:{version}"

}
----

Note that the default token storage system is JWT. If you want a different one, you need to install an additional
artifact. For instance, for Memcached:

[source,groovy,subs="attributes+"]
.`build.gradle`
----

ext.springSecurityRestVersion = '{version}'

dependencies {

    //Other dependencies

    compile "org.grails.plugins:spring-security-rest:${springSecurityRestVersion}"
    compile "org.grails.plugins:spring-security-rest-memcached:${springSecurityRestVersion}"

}
----

The Maven coordinates are the following:

. Grails Cache: `org.grails.plugins:spring-security-rest-grailscache`.
. Memcached: `org.grails.plugins:spring-security-rest-memcached`.
. GORM: `org.grails.plugins:spring-security-rest-gorm`.
. Redis: `org.grails.plugins:spring-security-rest-redis`.

Note that configuration properties such as `grails.plugin.springsecurity.rest.token.storage.useMemcached` are no longer
used. Every submodule of the above list will automatically configure the token store appropriately

If you want your own token storage system, you need to implement
http://alvarosanchez.github.io/grails-spring-security-rest/latest/docs/gapi/grails/plugin/springsecurity/rest/token/storage/TokenStorageService.html[TokenStorageService]
and register it in `resources.groovy` as `tokenStorageService`.

=== Plugin configuration

This plugin is compatible by default with Spring Security core traditional, form-based authentication. The important thing
to remember is: you have to separate the filter chains, so different filters are applied on each case.

The stateless, token-based approach of this plugin is incompatible with the HTTP session-based approach of Spring Security,
core, so the trick is to identify what URL patterns have to be stateless, and what others have to be stateful (if any).

To configure the chains properly, you can use the `grails.plugin.springsecurity.filterChain.chainMap` property:

[source,groovy]
.Listing {counter:listing}. `grails.plugin.springsecurity.filterChain.chainMap`
----
grails.plugin.springsecurity.filterChain.chainMap = [
    //Stateless chain
    [
        pattern: '/api/**',
        filters: 'JOINED_FILTERS,-anonymousAuthenticationFilter,-exceptionTranslationFilter,-authenticationProcessingFilter,-securityContextPersistenceFilter,-rememberMeAuthenticationFilter'
    ],

    //Traditional chain
    [
        pattern: '/**',
        filters: 'JOINED_FILTERS,-restTokenValidationFilter,-restExceptionTranslationFilter'
    ]
]
----

To understand this syntax, please read the
https://grails-plugins.github.io/grails-spring-security-core/v3/index.html#filters[Spring Security Core documentation].
Long story short: `JOINED_FILTERS` refers to all the configured filters. The minus (`-`) notation means all the previous values
but the neglected one.

So the first chain applies all the filters except the stateful ones. The second one applies all the filters but the stateless ones.

[NOTE]
====
Make sure that the stateless chain applies not only to your REST controllers, but also to the URL's where this plugin
filters are listening: by default, `/api/login` for authentication, `/api/logout` for
logout and `/api/validate` for token validation.
====

The difference is that, in a traditional form-based authentication, Spring Security will respond with an HTTP 302 redirect
to the login controller. That doesn't work for an API, so in the stateless approach, an HTTP 401 response will be sent back.
