The Spring Security Rest plugin fires events exactly like Spring Security Core does.

=== Event Notification

You can set up event notifications in two ways. The sections that follow describe each approach in more detail.

. Register an event listener, ignoring events that do not interest you. Spring allows only partial event subscription;
  you use generics to register the class of events that interest you, and you are notified of that class and all subclasses.

. Register one or more callback closures in `grails-app/conf/application.groovy` that take advantage of the plugin's
  `grails.plugin.springsecurity.rest.RestSecurityEventListener`. The listener does the filtering for you.

==== AuthenticationEventPublisher

Spring Security REST publishes events using an
http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/4.0.x/apidocs/org/springframework/security/authentication/AuthenticationEventPublisher.html[AuthenticationEventPublisher]
which in turn fire events using the
http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/4.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/ApplicationEventPublisher.html[ApplicationEventPublisher].
By default no events are fired since the `AuthenticationEventPublisher` instance registered is a
`grails.plugin.springsecurity.rest.authentication.NullRestAuthenticationEventPublisher`. But you can enable event
publishing by setting `grails.plugin.springsecurity.useSecurityEventListener = true` in `grails-app/conf/application.[groovy|yml]`.

You can use the `useSecurityEventListener` setting to temporarily disable and enable the callbacks, or enable them
per-environment.

==== Token Creation

Currently the Spring Security REST plugin supports a single event in addition to the default spring security events.
The event is fired whenever a new token is created. See `grails.plugin.springsecurity.rest.RestTokenCreationEvent`

[NOTE]
====
Every time a token is successfully submitted, an `AuthenticationSuccessEvent` will be fired.

=== Registering an Event Listener

Enable events with `grails.plugin.springsecurity.useSecurityEventListener = true` and create one or more Groovy or Java
classes, for example:

[source,groovy]
.Listing {counter:listing}. Custom event listener
----
package com.foo.bar

import org.springframework.context.ApplicationListener
import grails.plugin.springsecurity.rest.RestTokenCreationEvent

class MySecurityEventListener
      implements ApplicationListener<RestTokenCreationEvent> {

   void onApplicationEvent(RestTokenCreationEvent event) {
      // The access token is a delegate of the event, so you have access to an instance of `grails.plugin.springsecurity.rest.token.AccessToken`
   }
}
----

Register the class in `grails-app/conf/spring/resources.groovy`:

[source,groovy]
.Listing {counter:listing}. Event listener registration
----
import com.foo.bar.MySecurityEventListener

beans = {
   mySecurityEventListener(MySecurityEventListener)
}
----

=== Registering Callback Closures

Alternatively, enable events with `grails.plugin.springsecurity.useSecurityEventListener = true` and register one or
more callback closure(s) in `grails-app/conf/Config.groovy` and let `SecurityEventListener` do the filtering.

Implement the event handlers that you need, for example:

[source,groovy]
.Listing {counter:listing}. Callback closures
----
grails.plugin.springsecurity.useSecurityEventListener = true

grails.plugin.springsecurity.onRestTokenCreationEvent = { e, appCtx ->
   // handle RestTokenCreationEvent
}
----

None of these closures are required; if none are configured, nothing will be called. Just implement the event handlers
that you need.
