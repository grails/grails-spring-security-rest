=== Full compatibility with Spring Security core.

Up to previous releases, this plugin was overriding "stateful" Spring Security core beans, to ensure a stateless behaviour.
After some users reported issues integrating this plugin with existing installations, version 1.4 now follows a more
friendly approach.

A new chapter has been created explaining how to configure the filter chains appropriately.

=== RFC 6750 Bearer Token support by default

Now, the token validation and rendering aligns with the http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750[RFC 6750 Bearer Token] spec.
If you want to keep the old behaviour, simply disable it by setting
`grails.plugin.springsecurity.rest.token.validation.useBearerToken = false`

=== Credentials are extracted from JSON by default

It makes more sense in a REST application. The old behaviour can still be used by using the corresponding configuration
property.

=== Anonymous access is allowed

In case you want to enable anonymous access (read: not authenticated) to certain URL patterns, you can do so. Take a
look at the [new chapter in the documentation|guide:tokenValidation].
