Since Grails 3.2.1, CORS support is built-in into the framework. Check the
http://docs.grails.org/latest/guide/theWebLayer.html#cors[documentation on the Grails guide] for more information.

If you are using any Grails 3 version prior to 3.2.1, you can define your own filter, as described in
https://github.com/davidtinker/grails-cors#grails-3[].

Alternatively, you can also use https://github.com/appcela/grails3-cors-interceptor[this plugin].
