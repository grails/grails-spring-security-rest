The Spring Security REST Grails plugin allows you to use Spring Security for a stateless, token-based, RESTful authentication.

{note}
This plugin depends on [Spring Security Core 2.x|http://grails-plugins.github.io/grails-spring-security-core/guide/newInV2.html].
Make sure your application is compatible with that version first. There is a
[feature request|https://github.com/alvarosanchez/grails-spring-security-rest/issues/15], that may be addressed in the
future if there is enough community interest / love :)
{note}

{note}
This plugin is only for Grails 2.x, and it requires at least Java 7.
{note}

The default behaviour of Spring Security is to store the authenticated principal in the HTTP session. However, in a
RESTful scenario, we need to make sure our server is stateless.

The typical flow could be the following:

!rest.png!

# The client application requests and endpoint that requires authentication, so the server responds with a 401 response.
# The client redirects the user to the login form.
# The user enter credentials, and the client sends a request to the authentication endpoint. The server validates credentials, and if valid, generates, stores and sends back a token to the client.
# The client then stores the token internally. It will be sent on every API method request.
# The client sends again a request to the protected resource, passing the token as an HTTP header.
# The server validates the token, and if valid, executes the actual operation requested.

As per the [REST definition|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer], the client is transferring its
state on every request so the server is truly stateless.

This plugin helps you to wire your existing Spring Security [authentication mechanism|guide:authentication], provides you
with ready-to-use [token generation strategies|guide:tokenGeneration] and comes prepackaged with JWT, Memcached, GORM, Redis
and Grails Cache support for [token storage|guide:tokenStorage].
